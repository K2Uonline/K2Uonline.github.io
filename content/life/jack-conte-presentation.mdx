Jack Conte is the founder of Patreon, and [in this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zUndMfMInc) he talks about the past of the internet and what it can be in the future. This speech is important for anyone who's on the internet, whether on social media or social media or social media. He tells of what things were, something the internet constantly tries to hide and erase; how he navigated it, something nobody really understood at the time; and how the future can potentially look, something people on social media don't actively think about. The content of his speech is invaluable, but I really really enjoyed just the form of his presentation. 

### THIS IS THE MOST PERFECT SLIDESHOW PRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. 
He synchronizes his words with his transitions perfectly. The slides are simple yet include all the information you need. He uses almost purely images to enhance his speech rather than put bullets for the important points he's making. He structures his speech immaculately, with an engaging narrative and such a smooth Hero's Journey story. It's past, present, future in it's simplest form. He links the big picture of the internet with the small picture of his life events. I wish, one day, I can give a presentation as perfect as this.

#### On another note
He describes his journey on the internet as a creator, and I think the biggest inspiration for how he could sustain a career from online and why he started Patreon was from Kevin Kelly's [1000 True Fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/). 

Kevin Kelly is the founder of Wired Magazine and a truly very brilliant modern thinker. He's an inspiration to me with his [Cool Tools blog](https://kk.org/cooltools/). I really love the book he made from past Cool Tool posts ([here's a presentation he gives about his book/blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUsm-wdOPZI)); there's a lot of tools recommended by Kevin Kelly (KK) and Adam Savage (and other experts in their fields). I really resonated with KK's entry for Homebrewing Mead where he talks about a book (Compleat Mead Maker) that he used to brew a 5 gallon batch of mead for his wedding, which I did too!

There's entries about storage boxes, socks, books on knots, kayaks, documentaries, composting, tool organizers, cat care, and anything around the house you can think of. The only bummer is that it was published in 2013, so there's lots of outdated tools, but it's great to hear why an obsolete tool is good and then go out on the internet to find an active tool that is good for the same reasons. I'd like to include the overall definition he uses for a cool tool:

>A cool tool is...  
>Anything useful  
>That increases learning  
>Empowers individuals  
>Does work that matters  
>Is either the best  
>Or the cheapest  
>Or the only thing that works.
