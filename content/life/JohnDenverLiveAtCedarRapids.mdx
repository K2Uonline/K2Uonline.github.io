## Live at Cedar Rapids - John Denver

Live at Cedar Rapids is a timeless capsule from an important humble man during a very eventful period in America.

Take some time and listen to this album in one sitting, treat it as a movie. He sings well written sings that have a lot of heart. He doesn't have the most amazing voice or range, but he sure knows how to convey emotion and the spirit of a man with simple songs. The amazing thing about this performance is how he weaves in different monologues about his life. He talks about farmers, his connection to the Challenger Disaster, and a call for peace during the Cold War. The call for peace ("Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For") is especially moving as he talks about the times he's gone to Russia, and the duet with the Russian singer is pretty amazing. 

It makes me think about our current celebrities and pop stars when they speak to politics, wars, or world events. John Denver seems so connected to the events he sings and talks about. He was there, he cared about those people, he wrote songs with the heart of the situation. 

Overall, Live at Cedar Rapids are songs and talks with a lot of heart. It will expand your emotional capacity, at least while you're listening to it and thinking about it.
