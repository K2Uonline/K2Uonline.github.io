I started working at **L3Harris** because I wanted to gain more industry experience and learn about engineering practices at different companies. I was interested in learning about other companies' documentation practices and design processes, so I could learn industry best practices and become a better engineer. I hoped I would be on a team of electrical engineers—both senior engineers who could mentor me, and younger engineers I could collaborate and be friends with.

The first year was pretty good, learning about the L3Harris ecosystem and previous projects that were being built upon, but eventually, work began slowing down. The majority of my projects were sustaining and documentation. I felt that the incentives to get projects done quickly and under budget were not encouraged; our team would push back deadlines, be prolonged by processes, and use as much money as possible. This didn't align with what I wanted from my work, and I didn't want these practices to be how I did engineering for the rest of my career. I always feel responsible for the things I build and take pride in creating a good system that works well for the user. I wanted more experience with faster-paced projects where I could learn new technologies, develop more prototypes, and have more responsibility over original designs.

When I started loosely interviewing for new positions, I was looking still in the defense industry and at larger tech firms, but after every interview I was never fully convinced it was the right role for me. After my interview with **Seacomp**, I actually felt excited hearing about their design process and their past products.

During my conversation with their electrical engineer, I learned that she works on a variety of projects all at different stages. I'm hoping that she has a good amount of experience because I want someone to learn from and ask questions. A drawback of Seacomp is the small team size, limiting opportunities to learn from more engineers. However, another senior engineer I know was telling me that it might be a good thing; it'll be trial by fire, where I will have to figure things out on my own. And that’s how you learn the best and retain the most.

During this season of my life, God has been showing me that I need to lean more into what makes me uniquely made in His image. I have certain strengths and traits that make me who I am, and I want to become the person God is forming me into:

- **Responsibility**: I take complete ownership of anything I build or commit to. I sometimes delay agreeing to things because I need to consider if I can do a good job. I want everything I invest my time and effort in to work well and help others.
- **Understanding, Analytical**: I strive to fully understand both people and systems. With people, I ask questions to understand their character and decisions. With systems, I want to grasp all the building blocks and their interactions so I know how it works from first principles.
- **Individualism, Relator**: Knowing team members deeply matters to me. I want to understand each person’s strengths and interests, and how they contribute to the team.
- **Serving Youth**: I believe a person's most important time of the life where they truly start to become who they will be is in their teens. I want to help each student follow a healthy and prosperous path, to point them toward Jesus, loving others, and pursing their passions.

I’m just looking to be more aware of these attributes, exercise them, and grow in them.
