A thing I've been learning at work is the importance of Show and Tell. You need to take credit for the things you've done and show people how you accomplished them. 

Keep in mind "the vertical". People in management and higher above you on the totem pole don't know what you've been doing all day and how much effort you've put in. They care about those outcomes and those tangibles you produce. They care about Scope, Time, and Cost [insert image]. They care if you improved any of those things. Once every two weeks schedule a catch-up and plan of attack.   

Show big picture ideas.   

Show:  
- pictures
- videos
- animations (gifs)
- simple labels
- block diagrams that are simple, logical, flow and have pictures
- the thing doing the thing and being obvious and not busy
- a simple, clean, non-distracting environment
- the simple steps of how you got there
- emphasize Size, Weight, Power, Cost and features of each iteration
- simple creativity (note: come up with a personal "design language")
- a little flare, not too much
- flashing LEDs
- things moving
- quantifiable metrics
- simple obvious charts that prove something
- short thing about how other projects could use it
- how you can use the thing in the future for something specific, give examples
- knowledge in this specific depth
- comparisons
- confidence
- the thing has style (presentation doesn't need a lot)

Do not show:
- lots of words
- block diagrams with complex words
- block diagrams with no pictures
- confusing diagrams
- confusing pictures
- technical details
- a development board without explanation about the next revision
- unimportant busyness
- distracting transitions


Continually show higher ups what you are working on and how efficient you are. Get in their face. Send them emails. Talk to them in the halls. Be quick, simple, to the point.

Keep in mind "the horizontal". People who know your same technical depth or are interested in what you do. They care about how you solved specific problems. They care about how you found a problem, how you troubleshooted, and how you came up with a solution. They care about your creativity, cleverness, teamwork, and humor. 

Once a week set up a technical catch up with these peers. 

Show your process.

Show:
- design decisions
- truths (is what you believe you are actually doing accurate to reality? aka - datatsheets and physics)
- planned path forward
- detailed flow/block diagram
- how what you've learned could be helpful to them now or in the future
- your knowledge of the thing you've been working in the depth so they know you're the guy for this depth in the future
- what platforms you're using and how (only if they don't know)
- paths you went down that were wrong 
- truths you thought were true but did not actually align with reality (aka wrong assumptions/understanding)
- prototypes
- what would you have done differently
- what are some future ideas based in this same depth
- where are areas to improve this project or look more into this depth?
- are there alternatives?
- comparisons
- hacks and cheap tricks

Do not show:
- weird things you did
- dangerous things you did
- maybe how long it took you (if it's embarrassing, project confidence)
- pessimisms
- giving up
- personal critique of someone
- writing something off without reasoning

Use this presentation as notes to your future self (remember they are your peer as well, they understand just a little bit more than you!).

When interacting with your peers outside of technical work (downtime at someone's desk, in the lunch room, outside of work) enforce positive emotions. Take the time to care about the other person; remember their family, significant events, or personal projects they're working on.

Also, offer up personal information. Try to be hyper-aware of this. Understand what you' re relationship with that coworker is. Personal funny anecdotes are appropriate for everyone. Personal sad, heavy, or even very personal happy (intimate) are not necessarily for everyone. Offer more intimate information just a step more personal than you are comfortable with. Note how the person acts if it makes them uncomfortable or if they lean in. If they lean in, then they care and will usually match intensity of personal information in the future. If they seem uncomfortable or short then don't take it personal and understand your level of acquaintance-ship.

When you finish a project, have a wrap-up with both "the vertical" and "the horizontal" (separately). Follow the above Show and Tell guide for each group, but now encompass the whole project lifecycle. For both groups keep it higher level and have main takeaways for each slide. Use a personal design language for the project (color palette, style, etcetera) to create a cohesive presentation that could be re-used for a higher business level presentation (for the vertical) or a separate peer presentation for peers who haven't been in the know of your project or are in a different field (for the horizontal). Save these for your personal use (if allowed) and for a future resum√©. 

Show and Tell will demonstrate to the vertical that you are reliable, effective, confident, solution-oriented, and capable of whatever is given to you. You want to pop into their minds when they come across a problem or new opportunity. Face time with solutions is the goal.

Show and Tell will demonstrate to the horizontal that you are willing to share, solve problems collaboratively, honest, hardworking, iterative, striving for truths, and capable of working through a problem logically. You want to pop into their minds when they have a problem or a similar task you faced in their future. The goal is that your peers know that you can process through a problem logically until you have a deep fundamental understanding of your project. When your peers move up the job ladder and become your vertical they will remember you. When your peers move to a different company and you want to interview they will remember you.

Show and Tell proves to people the things you have already proven to yourself. It helps you retain information more effectively and helps future you reference long past problems that you forgot the solution to. 

Just show others that you are actually doing a thing and not just playing computer Solitaire all day.
