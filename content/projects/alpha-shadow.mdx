# Project Alpha Shadow

**Start Date:** 6/25/2025  
**Goal:** Design, build, and test a PCB in 4 months.

## Motivation

I came to my new job because I thought I'd have a lot more design work. I love creating a PCB that will accomplish a mission.

It feels like in the near term there won't be much work like that, so I'll have to do it in my free time. This is **Project Alpha Shadow**.

It doesn't really matter what the project is — it just needs to exist physically and accomplish its purpose.

## Project Ideas

* E-bike Bluetooth Speaker  
* Home Surveillance Camera
* Cat Tracker

## E-bike Bluetooth Speaker

### Function Blocks

* **Power Input:** 48–72V battery voltage

  * Control music playback
* **Physical Buttons** for manual music control
* **SIM Card** slot for downloaded music
