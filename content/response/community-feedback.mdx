I recently received several thoughtful questions from readers about balancing faith and a career in technology. Here are my responses:

## On Faith in the Workplace

**Q: How do you maintain your faith in a secular tech environment?**

This is a great question that many Christians in tech face. I've found that:

- Living by example is more powerful than words
- Finding like-minded colleagues for support
- Being authentic while respecting others' beliefs
- Using skills to serve others

## Career Growth and Values

**Q: How do you make career decisions that align with your values?**

Making career decisions requires:

1. Prayer and reflection
2. Seeking wise counsel
3. Evaluating opportunities against personal values
4. Considering impact on work-life balance

## Technology and Ministry

**Q: How can we use technology for ministry?**

Some ways to use tech skills for ministry:

- Helping churches with their digital presence
- Creating apps for Bible study
- Supporting non-profit organizations
- Teaching tech skills to others

Thank you for all your questions! Keep them coming, and I'll continue to address them in future posts.
